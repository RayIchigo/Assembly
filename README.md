# Assembly
This project was made using Onshape. I created two parts: a hinge and an elbow. After designing them separately, I assembled them to see how they connect and move together.

## Created With
- **Onshape**  
  [Visit Onshape](https://www.onshape.com/en/)

## Project Workflow
1. **Part Design** â€“ Both the hinge and elbow were drawn as separate 3D parts.  
2. **Assembly** â€“ The two parts were assembled using Onshapeâ€™s constraint and mate tools to demonstrate their connection and movement.
